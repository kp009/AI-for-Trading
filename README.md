# AI-for-Trading  
#### Udacity Nanodegree Course  

This repository showcases a series of sophisticated projects from the **AI-for-Trading Nanodegree** at Udacity. These projects demonstrate my ability to apply cutting-edge **machine learning**, **data science**, and **financial modeling** techniques to solve real-world trading problems.  

### Projects:  

1. **Trading with Momentum**  
   Developed a momentum-based trading strategy leveraging historical price data to identify stocks with the strongest upward or downward price movements.  
   - **Skills**: **Time Series Analysis**, **Predictive Modeling**, **Machine Learning**  
   - **Tools**: **Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, **NumPy**

2. **Breakout Strategy**  
   Created a strategy that identifies key support and resistance levels in stocks and executes trades when the price breaks through these levels.  
   - **Skills**: **Technical Analysis**, **Algorithmic Trading**, **Backtesting**  
   - **Tools**: **Python**, **Matplotlib**

3. **Smart Beta and Portfolio Optimization**  
   Applied **Smart Beta** strategies for creating optimized investment portfolios based on factor investing principles like **value**, **momentum**, and **volatility**.  
   - **Skills**: **Portfolio Management**, **Quantitative Analysis**, **Risk Management**  
   - **Tools**: **Python**, **Pandas**, **SciPy**

4. **Alpha Research and Factor Modeling**  
   Conducted research and built factor models to identify alpha-generating factors such as momentum, value, and earnings quality for stock prediction.  
   - **Skills**: **Factor Analysis**, **Alpha Generation**, **Predictive Analytics**  
   - **Tools**: **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**

5. **NLP on Financial Statements**  
   Applied **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze financial statements and extract key information to predict stock performance based on textual data.  
   - **Skills**: **NLP**, **Text Mining**, **Sentiment Analysis**  
   - **Tools**: **Python**, **NLTK**

6. **Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks**  
   Built a **neural network model** for sentiment analysis to gauge market sentiment from **news articles** and **social media**. This project aimed to predict stock price movements based on investor sentiment.  
   - **Skills**: **Deep Learning**, **Sentiment Analysis**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
   - **Tools**: **Python**, **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, **NLTK**

7. **Combining Signals for Enhanced Alpha**  
   Integrated multiple signals, including **technical indicators**, **sentiment analysis**, and **fundamental factors**, into a unified strategy for generating superior alpha and improving returns.  
   - **Skills**: **Machine Learning**, **Signal Processing**, **Quantitative Trading**  
   - **Tools**: **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**

8. **Backtesting**  
   Developed a robust **backtesting framework** to evaluate trading strategies using historical data, including risk-adjusted returns, drawdowns, and performance metrics. This allowed for rigorous strategy validation.  
   - **Skills**: **Backtesting**, **Risk Analysis**, **Performance Metrics**  
   - **Tools**: **Python**, **Matplotlib**, **Pandas**
